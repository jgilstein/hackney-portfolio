# Hackney Portfolio Website

This is a professional portfolio site built using **Next.js** and deployed with **Vercel** to showcase my internship experience at **The H.T. Hackney Company**.

## About the Project

Over an 8-week internship, I audited over 300+ convenience stores and visualized Great American Deli (GAD) sales and merchandising performance using Tableau. This site brings together:
- Public-facing visuals from the final dashboard
- Summary documents (one-pager + slide deck)
- A breakdown of key KPIs and regional findings

## Tools Used

- **React / Next.js** – For building the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling
- **Tableau** – For dashboards and data visualization
- **GitHub + Vercel** – For version control and live hosting
